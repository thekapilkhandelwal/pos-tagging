## What is Part of Speech (POS) tagging?
POS tagging is the process of tagging or associating each word
of a sentence with a proper ‘Part Of Speech (POS)’. POS tags are
also known as word classes, morphological classes, or lexical tags
A large amount of information about a word and its neighbours can be
obtained by POS Tags.POS Tagging is applicable to a whole load of
variety of tasks such as applications  information retrieval, parsing,
Text to Speech (TTS) applications, information extraction, linguistic
research for corpora. Here, we will implement this POS tagging with the 
Hidden Makrow model (HMM).
